Delegates

rule of using delegates

1.delegate is a user-defined type .before invoking/calling a method using delegate we must have to define a delagate
2.The signature of delegate must match with the signature of the method.
otherwise we will get a compiler time error
because of the above we call it as type-sfe function pointer

3.delegate is similar to class. 
we create an instance of the delegate when we do so we pass function as a parameter to the delegate constructor

types of delegates
