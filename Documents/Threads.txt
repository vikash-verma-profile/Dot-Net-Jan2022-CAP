Collections==> is a class that is useful to manage a group of objects in a flexible manner to perform various operations like
-insert
-update
-delete
-get etc

collection types:-

1.Generic==>System.collection.Generic
2. Non-Generic==>system.collection
3.Concurrent==>system.collections.concurrent


NON-GENERIC COllection-

-ArrayList==>is useful to represent an array of objects whose size is dynamically increased as required
-Queue==>it is useful to represent a FIFO(first IN ,First Out)collection of objects
-Stack==>it is useful to represent a LIFO(Last In ,First OUT) collection of objects
-HashTable==>it is useful to represent a collection of key/value pairs orgainized based on the key's hash code

GENERIC Collection-

-LIST==>list of obects that can be accessed by an index
-Dicitionary==>it will be useful to represent a collection of key/value pairs organised based on the key
-Queue==>it is useful to represent a FIFO(first IN ,First Out)collection of objects
-stack==>it is useful to represent a LIFO(Last In ,First OUT) collection of objects
-SortedList==>it is useful to repesent a collection of key/value sorted by key


concurrent Collections

these collections are useful for accessing collection items from multple threads 


-BlockingCollection-is useful to provide blocking anc bounding capabilities for thread-safe collections
-ConcurrentBag
-ConcurrentDictionary
-ConcurrentQueue
-ConcurentStack
-Partitioner
-orderablePartitioner



C# multithreading
=>its a process in which multiple threads work simultaneously
=> we need to use system.threading namspace


system.threading
--thread
--Mutex
--Timer
--Monitor
--Semaphore
--TheadLocal
--ThreadPool
--Volatile

Thread Properties

--CurrentThread--return the instance of currently running thread
--IsAlive--check whether the current thread is alive or not.It is used to find the execution status of the thread.
--IsBackground--is used to get or set value whether current thread is in background or not
--ManagedThreadId-to get unique id for the current managed thread
--Name--to get and set the name of the current thread
--Priority-get and set the priority of the current thread
--Threadstate--this will retun a value to represent the thread state

Thread Methods

--Abort()--to terminate the thread.
--Interrupt()--to interrut a thread which is in waitSleepJoin state
--Join()--block all the calling threads until this thread terminates
--ResetAbort()-cancel the abort request
--Sleep()--to suspend the current thread for miliseconds
--Resume()--to resume the susoended thread
--start()--start the therad and make the  state as runnable
--suspend()--suspends the current thread if it is not susspended
--yield()--to yield the execution if current thread to another thread

Thread

--running
--stoprequested
--suspendrequested
--background
--unstarted
--stopped
--waitsleepjoin
--suspended
--abortrequested
--aborted

type of thread:-

Foreground Thread-these threads are those whose lifespan does not depends on the main thread
Background Thread-these threads are those which depend on main method


MultiThreading:-

means to execute multiple threads simultaneously to perform mutiple tasks at a time.
